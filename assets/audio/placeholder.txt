- Volume should be subtle (20-40% of ambient levels)
- No jarring or video-game-like sounds that break immersion
- Consider having slightly different versions of common sounds to avoid repetition
- All effects should feel period-appropriate (1970s-1990s)

Note: All audio should reflect the serious historical nature of The Troubles period (1960s-1990s Northern Ireland) with respect for victims and historical accuracy.
